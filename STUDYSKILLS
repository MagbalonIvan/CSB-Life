<b>* Have you ever failed an exam? What were the reasons for failing?</b>

<i>Yes, I have failed not only once, though they were quizzes and not major exams, which still greatly affects my grade. I think I failed in those quizzes, because, I forgot to study for those quizzes, in which they're usually surprise quizzes.</i>

<b>*For those who haven't failed an exam, what was your highest score in an exam? What do you think made you reach the top? (Why are you not answering this question?)</b>

<i>I am not answering this question for the reason that I failed in some quizzes and that I think, it's impossible not to fail since you have to learn from you failures to make things as perfect as you can. One has to learn not to commit the same mistakes.</i>

<b>*How was your first experience of DLS-CSB Midterm Examinations? Knowing what you know now, what would you have done differently? What are you going to do again for the finals?</b>

<i>My first experience was okay so far, yet a bit different from my previous exams. Though, the difficulty was still the same but a bit more complicated this time, because the mid terms that we had and some mid term projects are being done simultaneously so we had to rush most of the time. I would've done more improvement in time management and lessening the distractions for the time being to concentrate on finishing the more important things. Though, I did study, what I'm going to do for the next exams is to still study but even more.</i>
